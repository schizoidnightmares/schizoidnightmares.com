I build my website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

## Content warning
As per [GitHub's Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-threats-of-violence-and-gratuitously-violent-content), I declare that some images in /assets/images/ contain fictional (i.e. illustrated) depictions of blood, gore, and suggestive imagery for artistic purposes. Some users may also find other creative content and themes present undesirable. Keep in mind that this repository relates to fictional works, [not real representations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-e46xdcUo).

## Notes

1. Use 4 spaces for tab size. Markdown seems to work properly with this format. Using only 2 spaces can create issues with lists.
2. Do not update page modification dates unless the *content* of the page changes â€” not simple formatting fixes.
