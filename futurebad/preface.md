# Preface of <i>[Futurebad](../)</i>
*Futurebad* is my first proprietary story. I have desired to create an alternate history for some time while being cautious not to connect it too much to our own (I write fiction, after all). My objective with *Futurebad* is not to write predictive fiction or hard sci-fi but rather to use the setting of Earth and some familiar places as a base for absurdist storytelling.

A friendly warning, *Futurebad* offers **no solutions** — none of my fiction does. I am not trying to tell readers how our world should (or shouldn’t) work or even how it does (or doesn’t) work. I am also not trying to bring attention to certain issues in our societies. I am not an activist or philosopher. I just write to release the imaginings in my mind. There is no higher meaning to my writing.

While I have tried many different kinds of writing throughout the years, I believe what fits me best is just trying to tell a story for the story’s sake.
