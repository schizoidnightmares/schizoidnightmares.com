# Support
There is currently no means of supporting my work beyond offering honest feedback. I am open, however, to eventually launching a Patreon. Some of my written works may also become available to purchase in physical form later in the future. My work, at least in digital form, **will always remain free**.

## Do *you* need support?
If it's related to my creative projects, you can <a href="https://tally.so/r/mOaDRp" target="_blank">contact me â§‰</a> for questions, concerns, or other inquiries.
