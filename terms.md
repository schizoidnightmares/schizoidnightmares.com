description: The terms of my website.

These terms apply to this website and also <a href="https://absurdrealms.com/" target="_blank">absurdrealms.com</a>.

## Privacy
I use <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/" target="_blank">Hostwinds</a> (they have their <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">own privacy policy</a>) to host my website from Dallas, Texas, United States. When you access my website, they automatically collect the following information from you:

1. IP address
1. accessed URL
1. date and time of access
1. referring URL (if applicable)
1. user agent

I will do my best to periodically clear the logs older than two months. However, that is a manual process, and I may not do it on time every period. You are welcome to <a href="{{ site.contact.url }}" target="{{ site.contact.target }}">contact me</a> about any privacy concerns.

Aside from investigating technical issues, I do not use this data for any other internal purposes. I also do not share this data with others unless in cooperation with the authorities. In such an event and unless compelled to otherwise by law, I would publicly disclose this cooperation with respect to both individual privacy and public transparency.

## Security
If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please <a href="{{ site.contact.url }}" target="{{ site.contact.target }}">inform me privately</a>. Due to limited financial resources, I cannot provide any financial rewards for useful reports. However, I am more than happy to acknowledge your work publicly. I will try my best to disclose reported security vulnerabilities promptly and responsibly.
