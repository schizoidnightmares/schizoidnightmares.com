description: The terms of my website.
---

These terms apply to this website and also <a href="https://absurdrealms.com/" target="_blank">absurdrealms.com</a>.

{% include toc.html %}

## Privacy
I use <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/" target="_blank">Hostwinds</a> (they have their <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">own privacy policy</a>) to host my website from Dallas, Texas, United States. When you access my website, they automatically collect the following information from you:

1. IP address
1. accessed URL
1. date and time of access
1. referring URL (if applicable)
1. user agent

I will do my best to periodically clear the logs older than two months. However, that is a manual process, and I may not do it on time every period. You are welcome to <a href="{{ site.contact.url }}" target="{{ site.contact.target }}">contact me</a> about any privacy concerns.

Aside from investigating technical issues, I do not use this data for any other internal purposes. I also do not share this data with others unless in cooperation with the authorities. In such an event and unless compelled to otherwise by law, I would publicly disclose this cooperation with respect to both individual privacy and public transparency.

## Security
If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please <a href="{{ site.contact.url }}" target="{{ site.contact.target }}">inform me privately</a>. Due to limited financial resources, I cannot provide any financial rewards for useful reports. However, I am more than happy to acknowledge your work publicly. I will try my best to disclose reported security vulnerabilities promptly and responsibly.

## Patreon terms
Since I have yet to publish my Patreon page (and may not for some time), these terms are only here for future use.

### General support
I will do my best to answer questions from patrons in a timely fashion. However, I cannot promise exact response times. There may be circumstances where I cannot answer questions promptly. My answers may or may not be satisfactory. I may also choose not to answer questions, especially those of a personal nature or that demand early access to a work in progress.

### Patron recognition
As an appreciation for financial support, I list patrons who consented to public recognition on my [credits page](/credits/) or elsewhere under the following terms:
{: .nip}

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>I list patrons in the order of tier and seniority, with higher tiers and older patrons (based on patronage duration â€” not date of birth) listed first. That may not happen right away. Website downtime, technical problems, or personal issues may get in the way.</li>
    <li>Patrons may, at any time, request the removal of their public recognition. I will do my best to complete their request in a timely fashion. However, their recognition may still be visible in perpetuity in public or private archives. Removing those archives is, likely, not possible.</li>
    <li>I will not list patrons if, by my determination, their display name or URL is objectionable by law, <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">my host</a>, or for other reasons. It is best to <a href="{{ site.contact.url }}" target="{{ site.contact.target }}">contact me</a> in advance if you have concerns or would like an exception (I grant none for illegal activity or what my host does not allow). What is always or typically objectionable includes but is not limited to names or URLs that directly (intentionally or negligently) promote or enable:</li>
    <ol class="lowercase">
        <li>sexual perversion or extreme obscenity (e.g. sexualization of minors, bestiality, sexual violence)</li>
        <li>terrorism, insurrection, treason, civil unrest, or sedition</li>
        <li>illicit (or irresponsible) use or distribution of weapons</li>
        <li>drug abuse (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, marijuana)</li>
        <li>threats, stalking, harassment, impersonation, defamation, or unlawful use of force</li>
        <li>organized crime, arson, vandalism, trespassing, illegal dumping, littering, or loitering</li>
        <li>fraud, theft, smuggling, piracy, quackery, or copyright infringement</li>
        <li>malware or spam (unsolicited messages)</li>
        <li>gambling, multi-level marketing, cryptocurrencies, payday loans, or other schemes that are likely to inflict financial harm</li>
        <li>interference with the ability of others to lawfully enjoy public or private property</li>
        <li>adult products or services (e.g. prostitution, escorts, pornography)</li>
        <li>political campaigns or political parties</li>
    </ol>
