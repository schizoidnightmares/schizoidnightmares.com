# Privacy
I use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> to host my website. Their privacy policy is available <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">here</a>. I can only see a basic summary of traffic to my site (visits, countries, bandwidth, etc.). I do not sell or provide this data to others. I cannot see individual users.
