## Support
I will do my best to answer questions promptly. However, I cannot promise exact response times. There may be circumstances where I cannot answer questions promptly. My answers may or may not be satisfactory. I may also choose not to answer questions, especially those of a personal nature or that demand early access to a work.

## Recognition
Before publicly recognizing a patron for their support (usually in [credits](/credits/contributors/) or possibly elsewhere), I must receive their consent via Patreon. I do not publicly display individual patrons' total contributions or tier history. If a patron no longer wants me to list them, I will delist them at their request from Patreon.

### Limitations
I reserve the right to refuse or remove a patron's public recognition. Reasons for rejection may include (listed non-exhaustively) avoiding associations with criminal, fraudulent, exploitative, pornographic, or seditious entities. If you want to become a patron for the sole purpose of obtaining public recognition, please <a href="https://tally.so/r/mOaDRp" target="_blank">contact me</a> ahead of time to ensure I will approve of it.

## Forums rank
I grant patrons a special user rank on <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.net/" target="_blank">the forums</a>, automatically granting <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.net/threads/user-status-and-ranks.6/" target="_blank">full membership privileges</a>. This rank is *conditional* and assumes patrons will comply with the forums' <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.net/help/rules/" target="_blank">rules</a>. Patrons registered on the forums should message me theirÂ forums username on Patreon if they want this rank applied to their account.

Former patrons *retain* these privileges, although they lose the special rank.
