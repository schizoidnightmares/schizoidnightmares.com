# Patrons
Since I have yet to publish my Patreon page (and may not for some time), these terms are only here for future use.

## Support
I will do my best to answer questions from patrons in a timely fashion. However, I cannot promise exact response times. There may be circumstances where I cannot answer questions promptly. My answers may or may not be satisfactory. I may also choose not to answer questions, especially those of a personal nature or that demand early access to a work.

## Recognition
As an appreciation for financial support, I list patrons who consent to public recognition on my [credits page](/credits/) or elsewhere under the following terms:

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>Once you consent to public recognition, I will store your desired public persona (including your self-identified country of origin), preferred contact email address, and your history of financial contributions in my private records. This is for me to rank you and fellow patrons according to your contributions and verify your identity should you decide to remove your listing in the future. I will remove this information from my private records if you no longer wish to be listed. Keep in mind that information listed publicly (i.e. your contribution ranking, desired public persona, and URL if specified) may be perpetually accessible via web archiving services. I do not publicly list your email address or your exact contribution amount. Here's an example of what information (including my URL) I would display (if I were a patron): 1. {% include flag.html flag="ca" %} <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.com" target="_blank">Schizoid Nightmares ⧉</a></li>
    <li>I list patrons according to their total financial contributions adjusted by inflation (and, in the case of ties, by seniority). However, patronage listing may be temporarily out of date. Website downtime, technical problems, or personal issues may get in the way of keeping it updated.
        <ol>
            <li>If also listed elsewhere, I may list only the top patrons.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>I will not list patrons if, by my determination, they or their URL is objectionable by American or Canadian law, <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">my host ⧉</a>, or for other reasons.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It is best to contact me in advance if you have concerns. I refuse to display, non-exhaustively, URLs or listed patrons that willfully, or by gross negligence, facilitate or incite:
        <ol class="cols2">
            <li>exploitation of children or other vulnerable persons</li>
            <li>malware or unlawful hacking</li>
            <li>lotteries, betting, or other gambling</li>
            <li>harassment, stalking, defamation, vandalism, sedition, or other anti-social behaviour</li>
            <li>quackery, drug abuse, or other potentially life-threatening activities</li>
            <li>intellectual property theft</li>
            <li>extreme gratuitous violent media</li>
            <li>payday loans or usury</li>
            <li>MLMs, pyramid schemes, or get-rich-quick schemes</li>
            <li>cheating in competitive games</li>
            <li>pornography or other sexual services</li>
            <li>(if main or significant purpose) cryptocurrencies, NFTs, affiliate marketing, or political activism</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

            <p>Under most circumstances, these objections only pertain to high-profile behaviour. It is not my intention to meddle or apply judgements based on the private affairs of others.
