# Patrons
The following terms are between me and the patrons of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/schizoidnightmares" target="_blank">my Patreon</a>.

## Support
I will do my best to answer questions from patrons in a timely fashion. However, I cannot promise exact response times. There may be circumstances where I cannot answer questions promptly. My answers may or may not be satisfactory. I may also choose not to answer questions, especially those of a personal nature or that demand early access to a work.

## Recognition
As an appreciation for financial support, I list patrons (both past and present) who consent to public recognition on my [credits page](/credits/) and possibly elsewhere. Patrons desiring public recognition must give me the name under which they wish me to credit them. Optionally, they may also provide the URL to which I should link their name and the country of origin I should display.

I display patrons according to their rank, which I determine by their inflation-adjusted total financial contributions (or seniority in the rare instance of ties). Outside the credits page, I may only display the top few patrons (such as on the home page). While I indicate rank, I do not publicly reveal how much individual patrons have financially contributed.

To keep track of patrons who consent to public recognition, I may store their information in my private records: Patreon username, display name, email address, total financial contributions, and duration of patronage. If a patron is no longer on Patreon and they desire to revoke their public recognition in the future, I can verify their identity through my private records. In such an event, once I remove their public recognition, I will delete their information from my private records.

Patrons should keep in mind that once they are publicly recognized, their public listing may be stored indefinitely in various public archiving services over which I likely have no control.

I reserve the right to delist (or deny listing) patrons or remove their desired URLs (more on this in the subsection below).

### Policy
For desired names, they must be the following:

1. A real name, initials, pseudonym, company, or organization
1. *Not* impersonate or be confused with another entity
1. *Not* vulgar or profane
1. *Not* publicly associated with criminal activities

For desired URLs, they must be the following:

1. *Not* shock, exploit, or endanger users
1. *Not* enable criminal or adult-restricted activities
1. *Not* referral links
