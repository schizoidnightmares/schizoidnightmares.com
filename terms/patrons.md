# Patrons
The following terms are between me and the patrons of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/schizoidnightmares" target="_blank">my Patreon</a>.

## Support
I will do my best to answer questions from patrons in a timely fashion. However, I cannot promise exact response times. There may be circumstances where I cannot answer questions promptly. My answers may or may not be satisfactory. I may also choose not to answer questions, especially those of a personal nature or that demand early access to a work.

## Recognition
As an appreciation for financial support, I list patrons (both past and present) who consent to public recognition on my [credits page](/credits/) and possibly elsewhere. Patrons desiring public recognition must give me the name under which they wish me to credit them. Optionally, they may also provide the URL to which I should link their name and the country of origin I should display.

For legal, moral, and reputational reasons, I will not list (or will delist) names or URLs publicly associated with the following:

1. Adultery, sexual deception, casual sex, exhibitionism, voyeurism, sexual fetishism, or risky sexual behaviour
1. Anti-competitive practices
1. Anti-social behaviour
1. Cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens
1. Extreme obscenity
1. Fraud
1. Gambling
1. Intellectual property infringement
1. Lobbying or affiliate marketing
1. Malware, denial of service attacks, or unlawful hacking
1. Multi-level marketing, get-rich-quick schemes, or other suspicious services
1. Other criminal behaviour, including suspected criminal organizations
1. Political organizations
1. Privacy invasion
1. Quackery or disinformation
1. Recreational body modification
1. Recreational drugs
1. Recreational fighting or killing
1. Self-harm or unlawful suicide
1. Sexual services
1. Terrorism, sedition, treason, or political subversion
1. Usury or payday loans

I display patrons according to their rank, which I determine by their inflation-adjusted total financial contributions (or seniority in the rare instance of ties). Outside the credits page, I may only display the top few patrons (such as on the home page). While I indicate rank, I do not publicly reveal how much individual patrons have financially contributed.

To keep track of patrons who consent to public recognition, I may store their information in my private records: Patreon username, display name, email address, total financial contributions, and duration of patronage. If a patron is no longer on Patreon and they desire to revoke their public recognition in the future, I can verify their identity through my private records. In such an event, once I remove their public recognition, I will delete their information from my private records.

Patrons should keep in mind that once they are publicly recognized, their public listing may be stored indefinitely in various public archiving services, of which I likely have no control.
