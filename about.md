description: About me and my works.
---

I am a man of English Canadian descent, born, raised, and presently residing in Ontario, Canada. I was first clinically diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder[^1] after entering adulthood. Since 2019, I have been creating amateur <a href="https://freedomdefined.org/Definition" target="_blank">free-cultural works</a> under the pseudonym Schizoid Nightmares. My works are partly a coping mechanism for my mental illness.

[^1]: Schizoid personality disorder is not the same as schizophrenia.

## Modus operandi
### Design
With the exception of <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.wiki/" target="_blank">the wiki</a>, I use a dark theme across all my websites. For the design, I try to accomplish the following objectives:
1. easy on the eyes, consistent, and minimalistic
1. lightweight and low data usage
1. no ads, pop-ups, auto-playing videos, excessive analytics, or unnecessary cookies (I presently use none)
1. responsive to different screen sizes and devices
1. accessible to most or all users (based on demand)

If you experience any problems with my websites, please {% include contact.html text="inform me" %}.

### Schedule
I have no fixed release schedule and often go through erratic periods of low and high productivity. To counter this, I release my works in segments. I am not so much a perfectionist (I am willing to accept "good enough" quality) â€” I just tend to go through waves of reiteration as more ideas come to fruition.

### Language
As a general rule, I produce my works, at least firstly, in **Canadian English**. I am open to releasing translations in the future according to popular demand. However, professional translations can be expensive, so that may take time.

## Supporting my work
There is currently no means of supporting my work beyond offering honest feedback. I am open, however, to eventually launching a Patreon in the future. My work, at least in digital form, **will always remain free and accessible** to all (no paywalls or early access restrictions).
