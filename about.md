description: About me and my works.
---

I am a man of English Canadian descent, born, raised, and presently residing in Ontario, Canada. I was first clinically diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder[^1] after entering adulthood. Since 2019, I have been creating amateur <a href="https://freedomdefined.org/Definition" target="_blank">free-cultural works</a> under the pseudonym Schizoid Nightmares. My works are partly a coping mechanism for my mental illness.

[^1]: Schizoid personality disorder is not the same as schizophrenia.

## Modus operandi
### Schedule
I have no fixed release schedule and often go through erratic periods of low and high productivity. To counter this, I release my works in segments. I am not so much a perfectionist (I am willing to accept "good enough" quality) â€” I just tend to go through waves of reiteration as more ideas come to fruition.

### Language
As a general rule, I produce my works, at least firstly, in **Canadian English**. I am open to releasing translations in the future according to popular demand. However, professional translations can be expensive, so that may take time.

## Supporting my work
There is currently no means of supporting my work beyond offering honest feedback. I am open, however, to eventually launching a Patreon in the future. My work, at least in digital form, **will always remain free and accessible** to all (no paywalls or early access restrictions).
