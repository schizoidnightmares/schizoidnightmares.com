## Artistic integrity
While audience considerations matter, maintaining a cohesive and genuine vision is more important. When I employ the services of an artist, I try to defer to their artistic instincts to maximize the output of their imagination without burdening them with doubt and perfectionism. In practice (with art), freedom achieves better results than constraint.

## Incrementalism
I develop and publish my work gradually over time, embracing change cautiously. I prefer to make small changes as opposed to large ones for several reasons:

1. There is less chance of causing critical errors
1. If a change is negative *and it is small*, it can be undone easier
1. Small changes allow myself and users to adapt easier
1. Small changes tend to go unnoticed and, therefore, without conflict
1. Small but steady change can still achieve comprehensive change over time

*I have and will make large changes if small changes are impractical.*

## Escapism
I create my work to explore fictional worlds — detached from our own. While my work may take inspiration from the real world, I do not intend it to be a commentary on it. I aim to help others escape into the imagination as a respite from reality. I am not an activist or philosopher.

## Absurdism
My work tends to explore existential themes, usually with mundane absurdity, collective apathy, or small concentrated doses of stylistic violence. Characters in my work often struggle to survive illogical circumstances — with the irrationality itself being their main threat. My imagination seems to function as a blender of my experiences, observations, and dreams under the anxiety of unreason.

## AI placeholders
In the absence of human-made content, I use artificial intelligence as a temporary substitute (i.e. a placeholder) with some caveats:

1. As much as law or licensing enables, I release *unmodified* AI-generated content to the public domain
1. Ideally, AI-generated content should be distinctive in style from human-made content, or at least from content produced for me by human artists, so as to not attempt to emulate or replace them or cause confusion
1. I do not pay for AI-generated content, but I am willing to pay to use AI tools, provided doing so does not prevent me from paying human artists
1. Once possible, I will replace the AI-generated placeholder material with human-made content
1. AI-generated content is only permanent if the use of AI-generated is part of my intent behind the art itself (e.g. some of my music videos)

*While I use AI to help proofread my writings and offer creative consultation or brainstorming, I never use it to generate the written material itself.*

## Free content
I release some of my works for free and under permissive licensing, such as *[Absurd Realms](/absurd-realms/)* (main literary series only) and my [standalone music tracks](/music/) (both under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0</a>, respectively). I do this for three reasons:

1. I started my work under the pseudonym Schizoid Nightmares as a hobby and did not initially intend to profit
1. Releasing work for free and under permissive licensing helps with marketing, possibly bringing attention to my commercial ventures
1. I have benefited from free content and desire to “give back”

*I may sell otherwise free works in different formats.*

## Accessibility
Making media accessible to those with visual or other sensory defects is important to me. While I cannot guarantee 100% accessibility for all conditions, I make an effort to improve the accessibility of my website and other projects to the best of my own abilities. As anyone’s sensory abilities can decline over the course of their life, I regard accessibility as a universal need and utilitarian feature that requires conscientious design.

*If you encounter an accessibility issue with my site or other projects, please <a href="https://tally.so/r/mOaDRp" target="_blank">inform me</a> and I will do my best to rectify the issue.*

## Minimalism
I take pride in keeping my website and other projects as minimalistic in design as possible. Minimalism serves three purposes: it helps keep computer resource usage low, creates fewer distractions to users, and is more efficient to produce. I do my best to keep it clean and simple. When a user visits my website, they do not experience irritants such as pop-ups or calls to action. Irritants such as these mimic the experience of being harassed by hoards of beggars and hustlers. I want users to experience relief with minimalism — like entering a soundproof booth after enduring hours of grating non-stop noise.

## Commercialism
I intend to profit from my work as doing so allows me to invest more time and resources in its production. It is not just a passion but also my attempt to secure a means of economic survival. When a project is proving too costly (in either time or money), I may terminate it to free up resources or just to survive. To avoid this, I seek to commercialize my projects to reduce the cost burden and make investing time more sensible.

*I believe that by engaging with the free market, both users and I stand to benefit more than by keeping everything strictly non-commercial.*

## Target audience
While I lack the raw data to back up my estimates, I do keep in mind which demographics my work *may* resonate with most for marketing purposes. I share this target audience for transparency and to satisfy curiosity. However, this may or may not accurately reflect my real users.

My overall target audience is alienated and/or introverted males living in Northern America, the UK, Australia, Germany, or Scandinavia. I expect this demographic to grow steadily over time. However, reaching this niche can pose great difficulty.

I determine my target audience through experience, speculation, and reading into trends. I do not actively track or analyze demographic information on my users — my target audience is not data-driven. I mainly go by instincts and common sense.

Methods of targeting may include focusing on appealing elements (particularly in fiction), online advertising, and maintaining a presence on websites expected to harbour these demographics.

*My target audience may vary per project. Having a target audience is for practical marketing purposes only. In no way do you have to fit it to enjoy my work.*
