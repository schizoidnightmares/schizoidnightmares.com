# *Modus operandi*

Over the years, I have developed seven work habits and values.

- [Artistic integrity](#artistic-integrity)
- [Incrementalism](#incrementalism)
- [Escapism](#escapism)
- [Absurdism](#absurdism)
- [AI placeholders](#ai-placeholders)
- [Free content](#free-content)
- [Commercialism](#commercialism)

## Artistic integrity
While audience considerations matter, maintaining a cohesive and genuine vision is more important. When I employ the services of an artist, I try to defer to their artistic instincts to maximize the output of their imagination without burdening them with doubt and perfectionism. In practice (with art), freedom achieves better results than constraint.

## Incrementalism
I develop and publish my work gradually over time, embracing change cautiously. I prefer to make small changes as opposed to large ones for several reasons:

1. There is less chance of causing critical errors
1. If a change is negative *and it is small*, it can be undone easier
1. Small changes allow myself and users to adapt easier
1. Small changes tend to go unnoticed and, therefore, without conflict
1. Small but steady change can still achieve comprehensive change over time

*I have and will make large changes if small changes are impractical.*

## Escapism
I create my work to explore fictional worlds — detached from our own. While my work may take inspiration from the real world, I do not intend it to be a commentary on it. I aim to help others escape into the imagination as a respite from reality. I am not an activist or philosopher.

## Absurdism
My work tends to explore existential themes, usually with mundane absurdity, collective apathy, or small concentrated doses of stylistic violence. Characters in my work often struggle to survive illogical circumstances — with the irrationality itself being their main threat. My imagination seems to function as a blender of my experiences, observations, and dreams under the anxiety of unreason.

## AI placeholders
In the absence of human-made content, I use artificial intelligence as a temporary substitute (i.e. a placeholder) with some caveats:

1. As much as law or licensing enables, I release *unmodified* AI-generated content to the public domain
1. Ideally, AI-generated content should be distinctive in style from human-made content, or at least from content produced for me by human artists, so as to not attempt to emulate or replace them or cause confusion
1. I do not pay for AI-generated content, but I am willing to pay to use AI tools, provided doing so does not prevent me from paying human artists
1. Once possible, I will replace the AI-generated placeholder material with human-made content
1. AI-generated content is only permanent if the use of AI-generated is part of my intent behind the art itself (e.g. some of my music videos)

*While I use AI to help proofread my writings and offer creative consultation or brainstorming, I never use it to generate the written material itself.*

## Free content
I release some of my works for free and under permissive licensing, such as *[Absurd Realms](/absurd-realms/)* (main literary series only) and my [standalone music tracks](/music/) (both under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0</a>, respectively). I do this for three reasons:

1. I started my work under the pseudonym Schizoid Nightmares as a hobby and did not initially intend to profit
1. Releasing work for free and under permissive licensing helps with marketing, possibly bringing attention to my commercial ventures
1. I have benefited from free content and desire to “give back”

*I may sell otherwise free works in different formats.*

## Commercialism
I intend to profit from my work as doing so allows me to invest more time and resources in its production. It is not just a passion but also my attempt to secure a means of economic survival. When a project is proving too costly (in either time or money), I may terminate it to free up resources or just to survive. To avoid this, I seek to commercialize my projects to reduce the cost burden and make investing time more sensible.

*I believe that by engaging with the free market, both users and I stand to benefit more than by keeping everything strictly non-commercial.*
