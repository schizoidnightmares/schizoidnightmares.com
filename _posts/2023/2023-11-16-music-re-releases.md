Two days ago, I re-released two of my older music tracks and music videos.

I originally released my experimental electronic ambient tracks "Life Cycle" and "Rainy Day" on June 11 and October 27, respectively, in 2020. I have listed the re-releases, along with their watch/listen links on [this page](/music/).
