Recently, I released my <a href="https://github.com/schizoidnightmares/schizoidnightmares.com" target="_blank">website's source code on GitHub</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/schizoidnightmares/jekyll-theme-schizoid" target="_blank">custom gem-based Jekyll theme</a>.

**UPDATE 2023-09-26: I have removed my gem on RubyGems since this post. To free up my time, I have also archived jekyll-theme-schizoid on GitHub.**
