title: How to keep track of my works
description: Methods of tracking include an RSS feed, Reddit, and Mastodon

As I do not offer an email newsletter, you can track updates from my website using <a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank">its RSS feed</a> (this requires an RSS reader), joining my subreddit, or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@schizoidnightmares" target="_blank">following me on Mastodon</a>.

**Updated February 16, 2024: The subreddit is no longer active.**

I considered several different options for a newsletter: the various freemium newsletter services out there or running one locally. None seem feasible. I created a Mastodon profile to expand my options beyond an RSS feed and the subreddit. This may seem odd, considering I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SchizoidNightmares/comments/zjkyap/leaving_twitter/" target="_blank">deleted my Twitter account</a> several months ago to reduce redundancy and lessen the number of accounts I manage. However, I find Mastodonâ€™s interface quite nice and do not find it very noisy compared to the former.
