There seem to have been some caching issues with Neocities for my website. I also desired greater administrative controls on the technical side. I have promptly switched over to Hostwinds to host my website as a result. Consequently, I updated my <a href="/terms/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.

**Updated March 13, 2024: I don't use Hostwinds anymore (I currently use Cloudflare).**
