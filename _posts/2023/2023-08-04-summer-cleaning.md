During the summer, I decided to simplify my website.

**Updated September 24, 2023: I updated my logo since this post. The updated version displays above instead of the one at the original time.**

Originally I planned to finish my short story "Flesh Run." However, I instead put my focus on my website design, which my website <a href="https://absurdrealms.com" target="_blank">absurdrealms.com</a> shares. I reduced clutter in the design â€” going for a cleaner presentation. I've also revamped the landing page for my website, showcasing my ongoing projects and concept ones.

Soon, I will update the *Absurd Realms* website with this simplified design.
