I have now launched <a href="https://absurdrealms.com" target="_blank">my website for *Absurd Realms*</a>. There you can read my latest stories, released as part of my fictional universe.

The website also has its own news feed (which functions the [exact same as my main website](/news/keep-track/)), where I post scene-by-scene updates. To avoid duplication, I will try to post updates of only complete works here.
