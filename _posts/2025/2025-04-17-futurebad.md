I have released the first scene of my first proprietary story, *[Futurebad](/futurebad/)*, a post-apocalyptic absurdist alternate history.

I have not worked out the business model yet for the story, but for now, I plan to just release it for free on my site, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/schizoidnightmares" target="_blank">Patreon</a> and others if possible (I may not post it on those that require/expect a cover until I can procure entirely human-made custom cover art). As a proprietary work, *Futurebad* is under full copyright — not permissive licensing like *Absurd Realms*.

Due to my low following, exposure over exclusivity is my priority for now.

Some business models I may consider in the future for *Futurebad* or other proprietary stories:

- Releasing scenes early on my Patreon for paid members only
- Releasing some scenes free, keeping the rest under a paywall via Patreon

Since I release my stories scene by scene, this restricts the more traditional methods of charging for access to writing (e.g. paperbacks, Kindle, ebooks). However, I am not against pursuing those options once the whole story is complete (and ideally once I’ve secured a professional editor, as prints can’t be “edited” after the fact).

## Other news

- The original website for *Absurd Realms* now redirects to [its page](/absurd-realms/) on my site
- I have finished archiving the contents of the Schizoid Nightmares Forums (you can find all archives on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://schizoidnightmares.net/*" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>)
- The launch page for PlotBible will come "soon"

## What about *Absurd Realms*?
It's on a bit of a hiatus. Advancing the plot forward in *Anthology I*'s "[Exodus](/absurd-realms/anthology-i/exodus/)" is complex since I go hard on "hard worldbuilding." There are a lot of details I need to keep track of, and I've never been satisfied long-term with [existing software solutions](/news/plotbible/#my-own-worldbuilding-needs-demand-it). Until PlotBible is ready or I discover a temporary alternative, it may take a while to continue my work on *Absurd Realms*. In the meantime, I am trying to explore other creative projects that are not as complicated.
