I have released the second scene, “[Next Stop](/futurebad/the-recent-centuries/next-stop/),” of the first chapter, “[The Recent Centuries](/futurebad/the-recent-centuries/),” in *[Futurebad](/futurebad/)*, as well as a “*[modus operandi](/about/modus-operandi/)*” and [jobs](/about/jobs/) page.

The *modus operandi* (“mode of operating”) page describes my habits and values *as they pertain to my work*. I added this page a few weeks ago, although I forgot to mention it in a news post. The jobs page was added recently as a place to advertise what kind of services I am looking for and also to offer my own.

A third scene for *Futurebad* is already well underway, but I am trying to be more thorough in proofreading and my own developmental editing.
