The merger of absurdrealms.com with schizoidnightmares.com is almost complete.

I have finished bringing over the website's [contents](/absurd-realms/), including the stories and a [news article about worldbuilding](/news/worldbuilding). However, the compendium will not be brought over as it will eventually re-appear on PlotBible in a new format in the future.

If you spot any errors or broken links, please <a href="https://tally.so/r/mOaDRp" target="_blank">inform me</a>.

Soon, I will redirect absurdrealms.com to schizoidnightmares.com once I've finished changing links elsewhere on third-party websites where I also publish its stories. Eventually, I will relaunch absurdrealms.com on PlotBible, but for now, this is best. This is not to abandon the *Absurd Realms* project, only to concentrate it all on one domain where everything will be easier for me to manage [as described earlier](/news/reform-and-renovation/) for the time being. I understand moving back and forth between domains is not ideal, but this is a necessary phase of transition. In due time, PlotBible will provide the order I aspire to.

Once I have redirected absurdrealms.com, I will publicly archive <a href="https://github.com/schizoidnightmares/absurdrealms.com" target="_blank">its GitHub repository</a> for perpetuity (foreseeably).

I am currently renovating the [gallery](/gallery/) to showcase and provide a directory for comprehensive attribution to all images on this site.
