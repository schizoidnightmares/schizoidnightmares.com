I intend to liquidate the <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.net/" target="_blank">forums</a> and use the web hosting service that has hosted it to host PlotBible instead.

This move will save both time and economic resources. Since [relaunching the forums](/news/forums-relaunch/) over a year ago, I have remained the sole registered user. I cannot justify spending time and money on its continued maintenance. A single-user forums just does not make any sense. While, with a larger following, it may be of future use, it is most practical to close it down and leave that responsibility to a third-party community — should such a thing ever exist.

I was anticipating a possible use for it in the future as a support hub for fans and patrons, but I think it would be more efficient to handle that over private communications and Patreon.

Even if it had been used by more than one user, managing a forums is a lot of work — mostly non-productive (i.e. managing people does not create content).

I will keep the forums up for at least the rest of March (registrations will be disabled), but I will shut it down after in the near future once the landing page for PlotBible is ready.

Consequently, since the forums will be shut down, I will no longer be offering preferential forums ranking for patrons.

I will archive (via the Internet Archive) all public forums content before I shut it down. Most content on the forums is content that I have posted already elsewhere.
