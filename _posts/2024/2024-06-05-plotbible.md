While admittedly, I'm not very business-orientated, after carefully considering all reasonable options, I have settled on developing my first proprietary service. This breaks from my tradition of exclusively developing open-source/free-cultural content, but financial and technical realities force this change. In truth, it requires me to go against my own instincts or "gut sense." However, I see no other alternatives. Allow me to indulge my reasoning.

## My own worldbuilding needs demand it
I have been unable to find any satisfactory software or services to handle my worldbuilding needs. Aeon Timeline, as mentioned in a post about my work with <a href="https://absurdrealms.com/news/worldbuilding/" target="_blank"><i>Absurd Realms</i></a>, has unfortunately proven not suitable for organizing the sheer amount of entities I wish to keep track of, and I find it lacking in automation features.

## Features at launch
As a proprietary online service, PlotBible will perpetually remain a work in progress. However, at launch, it will have the following base features:

- Public and private worlds
- Dynamic time-based entity properties
- Support for custom Gregorian-like calendars
- Automatic linear timelines based on entity dates and events
- Prebuilt and customizable entity types
- Data export and import
- Automatic spoiler control based on user-inputted time

## Pricing
As a commercial operation, I certainly intend to make money from PlotBible (ideally a living, but at the very least breaking even). This is not just a matter of self-employment but also making the service possible to begin with. It is my goal to keep pricing reasonable and competitive. The starting tier will be $5 USD monthly (with a 7-day free trial). I will handle payments using <a href="https://www.patreon.com/schizoidnightmares" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. If you intend to join my Patreon solely for this purpose, **please wait until PlotBible is actually launched**.

## Refund policy
At the start of the free trial (for new subscribers) or confirmation of payment (for recurring subscribers), I will allow a 14-day refund window (refunds granted on request). Repeated requests from the same subscriber for refunds may, however, result in a refusal of future business. If, for whatever reason, I terminate a subscriber's service during an active subscription, I will issue a refund for the approximate time left in their paid subscription.

## Content policy
I intend people to use PlotBible for *fictional* works. I do not recommend including personal information on PlotBible, especially in public worlds. I prohibit pornographic content, particularly in a visual or auditory form, primarily due to personal discomfort but also to avoid running foul of international censors. It goes without question that I also do not welcome other illegal content. However, I will not actively monitor or moderate the content on PlotBible unless I am given a reason. This is especially true for private worlds.

My own fiction is not "family-friendly," so it is not like these content restrictions will go overboard. That being said, I have no tolerance for content that glorifies universally condemned material, such as sexual assault (including child molestation) or bestiality, even if it doesn't technically cross the line into illegality.

I expect that the vast majority of users will not encounter difficulties with content policy compliance.
