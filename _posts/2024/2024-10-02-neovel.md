I have not been able to access Neovel.

Neovel is one of many platforms I use(d) to self-publish my stories from *<a href="https://absurdrealms.com/" target="_blank">Absurd Realms</a>*. Unfortunately, it does not appear to work anymore.

According to a review on Google Play for its Android app, it has not been working since late June. Since they did not answer my past inquiry (unrelated to this), I can assume the platform is either abandoned or experiencing serious operational issues for the foreseeable future.

As a heads-up, I will no longer update my stories on that platform. If you used it to keep track of my stories, consider using my site for *Absurd Realms* or becoming a free member on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/schizoidnightmares" target="_blank">Patreon</a> (where I try to post updates first). You can also <a href="https://schizoidnightmares.net" target="_blank">join my forums</a> or track my stories [elsewhere](/about/#profiles).

## Regarding my "hiatus"
I last updated one of my stories back in April. It's been a while, but I have not ceased my work.

Right now, I'm busy developing [PlotBible](/news/plotbible/), which will help me organize my worldbuilding in the future. In the meantime, however, I have recognized that I must keep my story moving forward with more frequent updates. I will spend more time doing what I need to do to make that happen, using an alternative to organize my worldbuilding before PlotBible is ready.
