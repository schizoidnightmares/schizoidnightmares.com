## *Absurd Realms*
*Absurd Realms* is an absurdist science fantasy series in an otherworldly universe based on my dreams and nightmares. This project aims to unify all my stories into one continuous narrative — told chronologically. The early development of *Absurd Realms* officially began in 2019 with my first anthology.

## Wiki
I founded the Schizoid Nightmares Wiki on October 30, 2020, to cover my works. Officially, the wiki is a collaborative project with collective attribution. I have been the sole contributor since the beginning.

## Docs
In addition to comments alongside source code, I try to provide documentation for my software releases, for my own remembrance, and also for others.

## Electronica
I have only composed and released two music tracks, both of the experimental, electronic, and especially amateur varieties.

## *Misanthropolis*
*Misanthropolis* is a (presently and likely for sometime concept) zero-player game simulating a small civilization of 50–500 people. It is, at least partly, a spinoff of *Absurd Realms*. I intend to ground *Misanthropolis* in hard determinism (i.e. the same starting conditions get the same results).
