## *Absurd Realms*
*Absurd Realms* is an absurdist science fantasy series in an otherworldly universe based on my dreams and nightmares. This project aims to unify all my stories into one continuous narrative â€” told chronologically. The early development of *Absurd Realms* officially began in 2019 with my first anthology.
